## Detailed Systems Design for `sabs-parent/server` Project (Laravel API & Web)

This document outlines the system design for the `sabs-parent/server` project, focusing on its role as a comprehensive Laravel backend serving both a RESTful API for the `sabsv3` React Native mobile application and a web interface. It covers the component, functional, and people views to provide a comprehensive understanding for both technical and non-technical stakeholders, specifically highlighting features exposed via defined routes.

### 1. Introduction

The `sabs-parent/server` project is a Laravel-based backend application designed to provide API services primarily to the `sabsv3` Expo React Native mobile application, alongside a full-featured web interface. It acts as a central hub for data management, business logic execution, and integration with various external services such as payment gateways (PayPal, Stripe) and other utilities. The system manages financial transactions, user accounts, loans, savings, and other related services within a CRM-like context.

### 2. Functional View

### 3. Component View

The system is built on the Laravel framework and primarily follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

#### 3.1. Core Framework and Language
*   **Laravel 7:** The foundational PHP framework providing structure, ORM (Eloquent), routing, middleware, and other essential services.
*   **PHP 7.2.5+:** The core programming language.

#### 3.2. Data Layer
*   **Eloquent ORM:** Laravel's built-in Object-Relational Mapper, used extensively for interacting with the database. Each `.php` file in the `app/` directory (e.g., `User.php`, `Account.php`, `Loanrequests.php`) represents an Eloquent model, mapping to a corresponding database table.
*   **Database:** The choice of database is not explicitly stated, but `doctrine/dbal` in `composer.json` suggests compatibility with various relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

#### 3.3. Application Layer (Controllers, Views, Routes, Middleware)
*   **Routing (`routes/api.php`, `routes/web.php`):** Defines all API and web endpoints, mapping HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT/PATCH) to specific controller actions.
*   **Controllers (`app/Http/Controllers`):** Handle incoming requests (both API and web), process data, interact with models/services, and return appropriate responses (JSON for API, Blade views for web).
    *   `ApiUsersController`: Central to API functionalities, handling user, customer, account, transaction, and reporting logic for the mobile app.
    *   `AuthController`: Manages user authentication (login, registration).
    *   Numerous other controllers (e.g., `AccountController`, `LoanRequestsController`, `InvoiceController`, `UserController`, `ReportController`, `SettingController`) provide logic for specific web-based modules and administrative functions, often complementing or sharing logic with API functionalities.
*   **Views (`resources/views`):** Blade templates are used to render the web interface.
*   **Middleware (`app/Http/Kernel.php`):**
    *   **Authentication Middleware (`auth`, `auth:api`):** Verifies user sessions for web routes and API tokens for protected API routes.
    *   **CORS Middleware (`Fruitcake\Cors\HandleCors`):** Manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the mobile app to communicate with the API.
    *   **Rate Limiting (`throttle`):** Limits API requests per minute (e.g., 60 req/min).
    *   **Authorization Middleware (`can`):** Integrates with Spatie permissions for fine-grained access control on both web and API.
    *   **Security Middleware (`XSS`):** Provides protection against Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
    *   **Standard Web Middleware:** Includes cookie encryption, session management, CSRF protection, etc., for the web interface.

#### 3.4. External Services/Libraries (Actively Used via Routes)
*   `fruitcake/laravel-cors`: For handling CORS headers for API access.
*   `guzzlehttp/guzzle`: An HTTP client likely used for making requests to external services like payment gateways (Stripe/PayPal APIs) or MTN integration.
*   `paypal/rest-api-sdk-php`: Integrated for PayPal payment processing via `PaypalController`.
*   `spatie/laravel-permission`: Robust role and permission management, evident in `PermissionController` and `RoleController` routes and `can` middleware.
*   `stripe/stripe-php`: Integrated for Stripe payment processing via `StripePaymentController`.

#### 3.5. Application Structure
*   **`app/`:** Contains core application logic: Models, Http (Controllers, Middleware), Providers, etc.
*   **`config/`:** Configuration files for various services and application settings.
*   **`database/`:** Database migrations, seeders, and factories.
*   **`public/`:** The web server's entry point, containing `index.php` and public assets.
*   **`resources/`:** Contains views (Blade templates for the web interface), language files, and uncompiled assets.
*   **`routes/`:** Defines all web (`web.php`) and API (`api.php`) routes.
*   **`storage/`:** Stores compiled Blade templates, file uploads, logs, and other generated files.
*   **`.env`:** Environment configuration for sensitive data and application settings.
